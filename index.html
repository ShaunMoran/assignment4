          <h2>Stratocaster</h2>
          <p id="testP">
            A perfect choice for beginners, the Squier Strat Pack has everything
            you need to begin playing right out of the box.
          </p>
          <p id="funParagraph">
            The Stratocaster is ideal for beginning players and provides a
            comfortable playing feel. It includes a lightweight body, a
            vintage-style tremolo bridge for classic pitch effects and three
            single-coil pickups for classic Strat tone.

          <h2>Ibanez RG120</h2>
          <p>
            The RG120 is an RG series solid body electric guitar model
            introduced by Ibanez in 2001. It is a special affordable spot model
            created for American musical instrument store chain Guitar Center.
            It was produced in both Korea and Indonesia through 2002, when
            Korean production was discontinued; after 2003 it was made in
            Indonesia exclusively.

          <h2>Explorer</h2>
          <p>
            The Epiphone Explorer features the same futuristic design and
            angular styling that appeared on the famed 1958 Gibson classic. Its
            resonant mahogany solidbody construction gives it impressive sustain
            and a punchy midrange.

          <h2>Fender CC-60SCE</h2>
          <p>
            Combining powerful onboard electronics—including a built-in
            tuner—with great tone and easy playability, the CC-60SCE is ideal
            for beginning to intermediate level players who are ready to plug
            in. The smaller concert-sized body is comfortable in any playing
            position, while the single-cutaway body provides easy access to the
            upper frets. Featuring a solid spruce top for increased volume and
            crisp sound, mahogany back and sides, and easy-to-play neck, the
            CC60-SCE is a perfect choice for the beach, the patio or the
            coffeehouse.
